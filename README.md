# Value-Iteration
The purpose of this project is to explore sequential decision problems that can be modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).

## Running the Program
Run "python3 gridworld.py -h" to see the available command line options.

## Example Command
"python3 gridworld -i 100"

## Acknowledgments
This program was for a computer science class taught by Bryce Wiedenbeck at Swarthmore College. He provided starting code.
